=================================
It bakes configuration for Zope 5
=================================

``cookiecutter-zope-instance`` is a `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io>`_ template to create a full and complex configuration of a `Zope <https://zope.org>`_ WSGI instance.

.. contents :: **Contents**

Features
========

- Creates basic file-system structure with ``zope.conf``, ``zope.ini``, ``site.zcml`` and  initial user.
- Set Zope's main configuration options.
- Configure different database backends such as local file-system storage, ``RelStorage`` or ``ZEO``.
- Enable development options.

All non-ancient features of `plone.recipe.zope2instance <https://pypi.org/project/plone.recipe.zope2instance/>`_ are provided plus new features.


Usage
=====

Install latest cookiecutter from GitHub with ``pip install "cookiecutter"``.

Prepare a ``instance.yaml`` with the parameters needed. A minimal example is (add option as needed):

.. code-block:: YML

    default_context:
        initial_user_name: 'admin'
        initial_user_password: 'admin'

        zcml_package_includes: my.awesome.addon, my.otheraddon
        db_storage: direct

Run:

.. code-block:: bash

    cookiecutter -f --no-input --config-file instance.yaml gh:plone/cookiecutter-zope-instance

Upgrading
=========

If you do not want to upgrade your configuration right away, you can still use the old version of the cookiecutter.
Just specify the version number with ``-c`` like: ``cookiecutter -c 1.0.1 -f --no-input --config-file instance.yaml gh:plone/cookiecutter-zope-instance``
Check the `releases <https://github.com/plone/cookiecutter-zope-instance/releases>`_ for the latest 1-series version number.

Version 1 to 2
--------------

- In 1.x variables ``debug_mode`` and ``verbose_security`` expected a string value "True" or "False".
  Since 2.x they expect a boolean value ``true`` or ``false`` as any other boolean settings variable.

- In 1.x the variable ``zcml`` was a dict with keys for the different settings.
  Since 2.x, for each setting there is a variable prefixed with ``zcml_``.
  This unifies the usage of the variables.
  If a list of values were given in 1.x, now a comma separated string is expected.
  See section ZCML below.

Options
=======

Base Locations
--------------

``target``
    The target directory name of the cookiecutter generated configuration.
    This is also the so called *INSTANCEHOME*.

    Attention, this is relative to current directory or to cookiecutter command line options if given (``-o PATH`` or ``--output-dir PATH``).

    Default: ``instance``

``location_clienthome``
    Zope's **clienthome** directory is were by default all writable files are written.
    Such as database with blobs, logs, PID-file, ...
    This is the only place, where the user of the WSGI process needs write access.
    Traditionally this is the **var** directory of the *instancehome*.

    Default: ``{{ cookiecutter.target }}/var``

Basic configuration
-------------------

``location_log``
    Base directory for all log files.

    Default: ``{{ cookiecutter.location_clienthome }}/log``

``wsgi_listen``
    IP address or hostname with port the HTTP server binds to.

    Default: ``localhost:8080``

``wsgi_fast_listen``
    Like *wsgi_listen*, but uses `waitress_fastlisten <https://pypi.org/project/waitress-fastlisten/>`_.
    Needs latter package to be installed (add it to *requirements.txt*).

    Default: empty string. Switched off.

``wsgi_threads``
    Specify the number of worker threads used to service requests.

    Default: ``4`` (since this is the waitress default)

``wsgi_max_request_body_size``
    Specify the maximum request body size in bytes.

    Default: ``1073741824`` (since this is the waitress default)

``wsgi_clear_untrusted_proxy_headers``
    This tells Waitress (WSGI server) to remove any untrusted proxy headers ("Forwarded", "X-Forwarded-For", "X-Forwarded-By", "X-Forwarded-Host", "X-Forwarded-Port", "X-Forwarded-Proto") not explicitly allowed by trusted_proxy_headers.

    Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``

    Default: ``false``

TODO: support all of https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/arguments.html

``environment``
    The environment set in ``zope.conf``.

    Values: It is a dictionary with key/value pairs.

    Default:

    .. code-block:: JSON

        {
            "zope_i18n_compile_mo_files": "true",
            "CHAMELEON_CACHE": "{{ cookiecutter.location_clienthome }}/cache"
        }

    Attention, due to a `bug in cookiecutter 2.2.0 to 2.5.0 <https://github.com/plone/cookiecutter-zope-instance/issues/15>`_ the value of the environment variable is not added or updated but replaced!

``environment_paths``
    Since all relative paths are turned into absolute ones, we need to tell the cookiecutter which environment variables are paths.
    By default it is set to ``["CHAMELEON_CACHE"]`` (when customizing, always include it)

``dos_protection_available``
    In Zope 5.8.4 and later, DOS protection is available.
    For older versions of Zope set this to ``false``.

    Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``true``

``dos_protection_form_memory_limit``
    The maximum size for each part in a multipart post request, for the complete body in an urlencoded post request and for the complete request body when accessed as bytes (rather than a file).

    default: "1MB",

``dos_protection_form_disk_limit``
    The maximum size of a POST request body.

    default: "1GB",

``dos_protection_form_memfile_limit``
    The value of form variables of type file with larger size are stored on disk rather than in memory.

    default: "4KB",

``enable_xmlrpc``
    Turn Zope's built-in XML-RPC support on or off.

    Zope has built-in support for XML-RPC requests.
    It will attempt to use XML-RPC for POST-requests with Content-Type header ``text/xml``.
    By default the XML-RPC request support is enabled.

    Due to the limited use of XML-RPC nowadays and its potential for abuse by malicious actors you can set this to false to turn off support for XML-RPC.
    Incoming XML-RPC requests will be refused with a BadRequest (HTTP status 400) response.

    Default: ``true``

``enable_ms_public_header``
    Set this directive to ``true`` to enable sending the ``Public`` header in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request - but only those coming from Microsoft WebDAV clients.

    Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard.
    Very few web servers out there include this header in their replies, most notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.

    Documentation about this header is sparse.
    Some versions of Microsoft Web Folders after 2005 apparently require its presence, but most documentation links have expired.

    Default: ``false``

``webdav_source_port``
    This value designates a network port number as WebDAV source port.

    WebDAV requires special handling for GET requests.
    A WebDAV client expects to receive the un-rendered source in the returned response body, not the rendered result a web browser would get.

    If this value is set to a positive integer, any GET request coming into Zope via the designated port will be marked up to signal that this is a WebDAV request.
    This request markup resembles what ZServer did for requests coming though its designated WebDAV source server port, so it is backwards-compatible for existing code that offers WebDAV handling under ZServer.

    Please note that Zope itself has no server capabilities and cannot open network ports.
    You need to configure your WSGI server to listen on the designated port.

    Default: ``0``

``http-realm``
    The HTTP ``Realm`` header value sent by this Zope instance.
    This value often shows up in basic authentication dialogs.

    Default: ``Zope``


Initial user
------------

``initial_user_name``
    Creates an initial user with the given name an "Manager" role (full web access).

    Default: ``admin``

``initial_user_password``
    Creates an initial password for the initial user.
    If empty, a password will be generated and printed after the cookiecutter generation process run.

    Default: empty string

ZCML
----

``zcml_package_metas``
    A string with comma separated values of ``meta.zcml`` files from packages to include.

    Examples: "my.fancypackage" or "myns.mypackage, collective.example"

    Default: empty string

``zcml_package_includes``
    A string with comma separated  ``configure.zcml`` files from packages to include.

    Examples: "my.fancypackage" or "myns.mypackage, collective.example"

    Default: empty string

``zcml_package_overrides``
    A string with comma separated  ``overrides.zcml`` files from packages to include.

    Examples: "my.fancypackage" or "myns.mypackage, collective.example"

    Default: empty string

``zcml_include_file_location``
    A (relative to ``TARGET/etc``) path to a ZCML file to include.

    Default: unused, empty string.

``zcml_overrides_file_location``
    A (relative to ``TARGET/etc``) path to an overrides ZCML file to include.

    Default: unused, empty string.

``zcml_resources_directory_location``
    A relative to ``TARGET/etc``) path to an Plone resource directory to include.
    Please refer to `plone.resource <https://pypi.org/project/plone.resource>`_ for more details and setup instructions.

    Default: unused, empty string.

``zcml_locales_directory_location``
    Specify a (relative to ``TARGET/etc``) locales directory.

    Default: unused, empty string

    This registers a locales directory with extra or different translations.
    Given you want to override a few translations from the ``plone`` domain in the English language.
    Then  add a ``en/LC_MESSAGES/plone.po`` file in this directory, with standard headers at the top, followed by something like this:

    .. code-block:: po

        #. Default: "You are here:"
        msgid "you_are_here"
        msgstr "You are very welcome here:"

    Translations for other message ids are not affected and will continue to work.

Database
--------

Zope/Plone offers different ZODB storage backends for different environments and needs:

- For development a simple local file based *direct* storage is all you need (aka filestorage).
- As soon as you want multiple application processes of Zope/Plone (horizontal scaling) you need to run a separate database server process and connect to it.

  - We recommend to use a PostgreSQL database using the *RelStorage* implementation for ZODB with *psycopg2* driver as database server in production environments.
    RelStorage supports very well MySQL (and derivatives), Oracle and SQLite 3 as database servers.
  - Zope and ZODB comes with *ZEO* (Zope Enterprise Objects). This more lightweight storage server is supported here too. It is widely used in production environment.

*Blobs* (binary large objects, like files and images) are handled in a special way:

In *direct* storage blob files are stored in a dedicated directory in filesystem.

With a *RelStorage* or *ZEO* there are two options:

1. Blobs stored within the primary database server as data.
   The application client needs a local (non-shared) cache directory for the blobs.
   This is recommended in general for *RelStorage*
2. Blobs stored in a separate dedicated filesystem directory.
   This directory is in shared usage by all application processes.
   If application processes are spread over many servers, a network filesystem such as NFS or similar must be used.
   This is recommend for *ZEO*.


Core database options:

TODO check here https://zodb.org/en/latest/reference/zodb.html#database-text-configuration

``db_storage``
    Which storage type to be configured.

    Allowed values: ``direct``, ``relstorage``, ``zeo``

    Default: ``direct``

``db_cache_size``
    Set the ZODB cache target maximum number of non-ghost objects, i.e. the number of objects which the ZODB cache will try to hold in RAM per connection.
    The actual size depends on the data.
    For each connection in the connection pool of the application process one cache is created.
    In other words one cache is created for each active parallel running thread.
    If in doubt do not touch.
    On the other hand it is a powerful setting to tune your application.

    Default: ``30000``.

``db_cache_size_bytes``
    Set the ZODB cache target total memory usage of non-ghost objects in each connection object cache.
    This setting sets an additional limit on top of ``db_cache_size``.
    The cache is kept below the value of either ``db_cache_size`` or ``db_cache_size_bytes``, whatever limit was hit first.
    If value is ``0`` the byte size check is switched off and only ``db_cache_size`` is taken into account.

    Allowed values: byte-size (integer format with postfix KB, MB, GB)

    Default: unset, empty string, database default of ``0`` is active.

``db_large_record_size``
    When object records are saved that are larger than this, a warning is issued, suggesting that blobs should be used instead.

    Allowed values: byte-size (integer format with postfix KB, MB, GB)

    Default: unset, empty string, database default of ``16MB`` is active.

``db_pool_size``
    The expected maximum number of simultaneously open connections.
    There is no hard limit (as many connections as are requested will be opened, until system resources are exhausted).
    Exceeding pool-size connections causes a warning message to be logged, and exceeding twice pool-size connections causes a critical message to be logged.

    Allowed values: integer

    Default: unset, empty string, database default of ``7`` is active.

``max_conflict_retries``
    The maximum number of retries on a conflict error.

    Default: ``3``

Blobs Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The blob settings are valid for all storages.

``db_blob_mode``
    Set if blobs are stored *shared* within all clients or are they stored on the storage backend and the client only operates as temporary *cache*.
    For *direct* storage only *shared* applies (operates like shared with one single client).
    Attention: Do not forget to set this to *cache* if you use RelStorage!

    Allowed values: ``shared``, ``cache``

    Default: ``shared``

``db_blob_location``
    The name of the directory where the ZODB blob data or cache (depends on *db_blob_mode*) will be stored.

    Default: ``{{ cookiecutter.location_clienthome }}/blobs``.

``db_blob_cache_size``
    Set the maximum size of the blob cache, in bytes.
    With many blobs and enough disk space on the client hardware this should be increased.
    If not set, then the cache size isn't checked and the blob directory will grow without bound.
    Only valid for *db_blob_mode* *cache*.

    Default: ``6312427520`` (5GB).

``db_blob_cache_size_check``
    Set the ZEO check size as percent of ``blobs_cache_size`` (for example, ``10`` for 10%).
    The ZEO cache size will be checked when this many bytes have been loaded into the cache.
    Only valid for *db_blob_mode* *cache*.

    Defaults: ``10`` (10% of the blob cache size).


Direct Filestorage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have only one application process, it can open a direct ``filestorage`` database files directly without running a database server process.
For details read the `Zope configuration reference <_https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operation.html#zope-configuration-reference>`_

``db_filestorage_location``
    The filename where the ZODB data file will be stored.
    Note: Side by side with the given file other ``Data.fs.*`` files (like locks and indexes) are created.

    Defaults: ``{{ cookiecutter.location_clienthome }}/filestorage/Data.fs``.

``db_filestorage_pack_keep_old``
    If switched on, a copy of the database before packing is kept in a ``.old`` file.

    Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``true``.

``db_filestorage_quota``
    Maximum allowed size of the storage file.
    Operations which would cause the size of the storage to exceed the quota will result in a ``ZODB.FileStorage.FileStorageQuotaError`` being raised.

    Allowed values: byte-size (integer format with postfix KB,MB,GB)

    Default: unset, empty string

``db_filestorage_packer``
    The dotted name (dotted module name and object name) of a packer object.
    This is used to provide an alternative pack implementation.

    Allowed values: dotted-name (string)

    Default: unset, empty string

``db_filestorage_pack_gc``
    If switched off, then no garbage collection will be performed when packing.
    This can make packing go much faster and can avoid problems when objects are referenced only from other databases.

    Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``true``.


RelStorage
~~~~~~~~~~

`RelStorage <https://pypi.org/project/RelStorage/>`_ is a storage implementation for ZODB that stores pickles in a relational database (RDBMS).

Note: Please see `Database`_ and `Blobs Settings`_ , as you will have to set ``db_blob_mode`` to ``cache``.
Usually you will also have to set up the correct DSN for your database.

General settings
""""""""""""""""

``db_relstorage``
    Set the database server to be used.

    Allowed values: ``postgresql``, ``mysql``, ``oracle``, ``sqlite3``

    Default: ``postgresql``

``db_relstorage_keep_history``
    If this option is switched on, the adapter will create and use a history-preserving database schema (like FileStorage or ZEO).
    A history-preserving schema supports ZODB-level undo, but also grows more quickly and requires extensive packing on a regular basis.

    If this option is switched off, the adapter will create and use a history-free database schema.
    Undo will not be supported, but the database will not grow as quickly.
    The database will still require regular garbage collection (which is accessible through the database pack mechanism.)

    Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``true``.

``db_relstorage_read_only``
    If switched on, only reads may be executed against the storage.

    Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``false``.

``db_relstorage_create_schema``
    Normally, RelStorage will create or update the database schema on start-up.
    Switch it off if you need to connect to a RelStorage database without automatic creation or updates.

    Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``true``.

``db_relstorage_commit_lock_timeout``
    During commit, RelStorage acquires a database-wide lock.
    This option specifies how long to wait for the lock before failing the attempt to commit.
    Consult and understand the RelStorage documentation before using this setting.

    Default: unset, empty string, RelStorage default of ``30`` seconds is active.

RelStorage provides advanced blob caching options.
For details about caching read `RelStorage: Blobs <https://relstorage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/relstorage-options.html#blobs>`_.

``db_relstorage_blob_cache_size_check_external``
    For details read original RelStorage documentation.

    Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``false``.

``db_relstorage_blob_chunk_size``
    For details read original RelStorage documentation.

    Default: unset, empty string, RelStorage default of ``1048576`` (1 megabyte) is active.
    This option allows suffixes such as “mb” or “gb”.

RelStorage provides advanced RAM and persistent caching options.
For details about caching read `RelStorage: Database Caching <https://relstorage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/relstorage-options.html#database-caching>`_.
The descriptions below are copied mainly from there (consult the original source, it may have changed!).

``db_relstorage_cache_local_mb``
    Configures the approximate maximum amount of memory the cache should consume, in megabytes.
    Set to ``0`` to *disable* the in-memory cache (this is not recommended).

    Default: unset, empty string, RelStorage default of ``10`` is active.

``db_relstorage_cache_local_object_max``
    Configures the maximum size of an object’s pickle (in bytes) that can qualify for the *local* cache.
    The size is measured after compression.
    Larger objects can still qualify for the remote cache.

    Default: unset, empty string, RelStorage default of 16384 (1 << 14) bytes is active.

``db_relstorage_cache_local_compression``
    Configures compression within the *local* cache.
    This option names a Python module that provides two functions, "compress()" and "decompress()".
    Supported values include zlib, bz2, and none (no compression).
    If you use the compressing storage wrapper "zc.zlibstorage", this option automatically does nothing.
    With other compressing storage wrappers this should be set to none.

    Default: unset, empty string, RelStorage default of ``none`` is active (to avoid copying data more than necessary).

``db_relstorage_cache_local_dir``
    The path to a directory where the local cache will be saved when the database is closed.
    On startup, RelStorage will look in this directory for cache files to load into memory.
    The cache files must be located on a local (not network) filesystem.
    Consult and understand the *Database Caching* manual before using this setting.

``db_relstorage_cache_prefix``
    The prefix used as part of persistent cache file names.
    All clients using a database should use the same cache-prefix.

    Default: unset, empty string, RelStorage default of the database name is active.

RelStorage has extra parameters for blobs.

If your database runs replicated, RelStorage supports handling of replications.
For details about replication options read `RelStorage: Replication <https://relstorage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/relstorage-options.html#replication>`_.

``db_relstorage_replica_conf``
    For details read original RelStorage documentation.

    Default: unset, empty string

``db_relstorage_ro_replica_conf``
    For details read original RelStorage documentation.

    Default: unset, empty string

``db_relstorage_replica_timeout``
    For details read original RelStorage documentation.

    Default: unset, empty string

``db_relstorage_replica_revert_when_stale``
    For details read original RelStorage documentation.

    Default: unset, empty string

Command Line Utilities
""""""""""""""""""""""

RelStorage provides helper scripts for packing (zodbpack) and import/export from filestorage (zodbconvert).

The configuration for the scripts is generated as separate file:

The file ``relstorage-pack.conf`` for the command line utility ``zobdpack`` is always generated for all RelStorage configurations.
For usage information read `Packing Or Reference Checking A ZODB Storage: zodbpack <https://relstorage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zodbpack.html>`_.

The files
- ``relstorage-export.conf`` is generated if the two ``db_relstorage_export_*`` settings are given, and
- ``relstorage-import.conf`` is generated if the two ``db_relstorage_import_*`` settings are given.

Both are for the command line utility ``zobdconvert``.
For usage information read `Copying Data Between ZODB Storages: zodbconvert <https://relstorage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zodbconvert.html>`_

At the moment only the filestorage with blobs is supported.
In future there may be more options, like converting from/to a ZEO-server or another RelStorage/Database.
Latter would be useful to upgrade a database or convert MySQL to PostgreSQL or vice versa.

``db_relstorage_import_filestorage_location``
    The filename of the filestorage to import from.

    Default: unset, empty string

``db_relstorage_import_blobs_location``
    The directory of the blob storage to import from.

    Default: unset, empty string

``db_relstorage_export_filestorage_location``
    The filename of the filestorage to export to.

    Default: unset, empty string

``db_relstorage_export_blobs_location``
    The directory of the blob storage to export to.

    Default: unset, empty string

ZEO
~~~

ZEO is a mature client-server storage created for ZODB for sharing a single storage among many clients.

All options can be found in the `Zope Configuration Reference under "<zeoclient> (ZODB.config.ZEOClient)"" <https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operation.html#zope-configuration-reference>`_

Main settings:

``db_zeo_server``
    Set the server address of the ZEO server.
    You can set more than one address (white space delimited).
    Alternative addresses will be used if the primary address is down.

    Default: ``localhost:8100``.

``db_zeo_name``
    Set the storage name of the ZEO storage.

    Default: ``1``.

Caching settings

*db_cache_size* and *db_cache_size_bytes* is taken into account.
Additional persistent caching is possible.

TODO: figure out what *cache-size* in ZEO client means.

``db_zeo_client``
    Enables persistent cache files.
    Set the persistent cache name that is used to construct the cache filenames.
    This enables the ZEO cache to persist across application restarts.

    Persistent cache files are disabled by default.
    If disabled, the client creates a temporary cache that will only be used by the current object.

    The string passed here is used to construct the cache filenames.

    Allowed values: string.

    Default: unset.

``db_zeo_var``
    The directory where persistent cache files are stored.
    By default cache files, if they are persistent, are stored in the current directory.    Used in the ZEO storage snippets to configure the ZEO var folder, which is used to store persistent ZEO client cache files.

    Default: unset, empty string, the system temporary folder is used.

``db_zeo_cache_size``
    Set the size of the file based ZEO client cache.
    The ZEO cache is a disk based cache shared between application threads.
    It is stored either in temporary files or, in case you activate persistent cache files with the option ``client`` (see below), in the folder designated by the ``db_zeo_var`` option.

    Default: ``128MB``.

ZEO supports authentication.
You need to activate ZEO authentication on the server side as well, for this to work.
Without this anyone that can connect to the database servers socket can read and write arbitrary data.

``db_zeo_username``
    Enable ZEO authentication and use the given username when accessing the ZEO server.
    It is obligatory to also specify a zeo-password.

    Default: unset, empty string, no authentication.

``db_zeo_password``
    Password to use when connecting to a ZEO server with authentication enabled.

    Default: unset, empty string.

``db_zeo_realm``
    Authentication realm to use when authentication with a ZEO server.

    Default: ``ZEO``.

ZEO has some advance options.
If in doubt better do not touch them.


``db_zeo_read_only_fallback``
    A flag indicating whether a read-only remote storage should be acceptable as a fallback when no writable storages are available.

    Allowed values: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``false``

``db_zeo_read_only``
    Set zeo client as read only.

    Allowed values: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``false``

``db_zeo_drop_cache_rather_verify``
    Indicates that the cache should be dropped rather than verified when the verification optimization is not available
    (e.g. when the ZEO server restarted).

    Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``false``.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
------------------------------------

Plone offers `CORS <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS`_ handling with the `plone.rest <https://pypi.org/project/plone.rest/>`_ package.
CORS configuration is needed, if you want to access the Plone REST API from a different domain than the one Plone is running on.

``cors_enabled``
    Enable CORS support.

    Allowed values: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``false``

``cors_allow_credentials``
    Indicates whether the resource supports user credentials in the request.

    Allowed values: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``true``

``cors_allow_headers``
    A comma separated list of request headers allowed to be sent by the client.

    Default: ``Accept,Authorization,Content-Type``

``cors_allow_methods``
    A comma separated list of HTTP method names that are allowed by this CORS policy.

    Default: ``DELETE,GET,OPTIONS,PATCH,POST,PUT``

``cors_allow_origin``
    Origins that are allowed access to the resource.
    Either a comma separated list of origins, e.g. ``https://example.com,https://otherexample.com``, or ``*`` for all.

    Default: ``http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000``

``cors_expose_headers``
    A comma separated list of response headers clients can access.

    Default: ``Content-Length``

``cors_max_age``
    Indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached in seconds.

    Default: ``3600``

Development
-----------

``debug_mode``
    Switches debug mode on or off.

    Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``false``

``debug_exceptions``

    This switch controls how exceptions are handled.
    If it is set to `false`` (the default), Zope's own exception handling is active.
    Exception views or a `standard_error_message` are used to handle them.

    If set to `true`, exceptions are not handled by Zope and can propagate into the WSGI pipeline, where they may be handled by debugging middleware.

    This setting should always be `false` in production.
    It is useful for developers and while debugging site issues.

    Default: ``false``

``verbose_security``
    Switches verbose security on (and switch to the Python security implementation).

    Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

    Default: ``false``

``profile_repoze``
    Enable profiling with `repoze.profile <>`_.
    Ensure to execute ``pip install repoze.profile`` before switching this on.

    Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

    Defaults to ``false``.

``profile_repoze_log_filename``
  Filename of the raw profile data.
  This file contains the raw profile data for further analysis.

  Default to ``location_log/repoze_profile.raw.log"``.

``profile_repoze_cachegrind_filename``
  If the package ``pyprof2calltree`` is installed, another file is written.
  It is meant for consumption with any cachegrind compatible application.

  Defaults to ``location_log/repoze_cachegrind.out.bar``.

``profile_repoze_discard_first_request``
  See `repoze.profile docs <https://repozeprofile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#configuration-via-python>`_ for details.

  Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

  Defaults to ``true``.


``profile_repoze_path``
  See `repoze.profile docs <https://repozeprofile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#configuration-via-python>`_ for details.
  The path for through the web access to the last profiled request.

  Defaults to ``/__profile__``.


``profile_repoze_flush_at_shutdown``

  Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

  Defaults to ``true``.

``profile_repoze_unwind``
  See `repoze.profile docs <https://repozeprofile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#configuration-via-python>`_ for details.

  Allowed values boolean: ``true``, ``false``.

  Defaults to ``false``.


Helpers
=======

Helper scripts for copy paste usage in projects.
Located in the ``helper`` directory of cookiecutter-zope-instance.


``transform_from_environment.py``
---------------------------------

Creates configuration from from prefixed environment variables.
This is useful for containerized deployments.

Precondition: Python 3 with `pyyaml <https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/>`_ installed.

It takes a YAML configuration file as input and outputs a YAML configuration file.
Any environment variable with a given prefix (``INSTANCE_`` by default) is transformed into a configuration variable.
The prefix is stripped and the rest of the environment variable name either add or replaces the configuration variable name.

Give we have a configuration file ``instance.yaml`` (like for development):

.. code-block:: YAML

    default_context:
        wsgi_fast_listen: 0.0.0.0:8080
        initial_user_name: admin
        initial_user_password: admin
        debug_mode: true
        verbose_security: true
        zcml_package_includes: my.fancy.package
        db_storage: direct

Then we set a bunch of environment variables for production:

.. code-block:: bash

    export INSTANCE_wsgi_fast_listen=
    export INSTANCE_wsgi_listen=127.0.0.1:8080
    export INSTANCE_initial_user_password=
    export INSTANCE_debug_mode=false
    export INSTANCE_verbose_security=false
    export INSTANCE_db_storage=relstorage
    export INSTANCE_db_blob_mode=cache
    export INSTANCE_db_relstorage_keep_history=false
    export INSTANCE_db_relstorage=postgresql
    export INSTANCE_db_relstorage_postgresql_dsn="host='db' dbname='plone' user='plone' password='verysecret'"
    export INSTANCE_db_cache_size=50000
    export INSTANCE_db_cache_size_bytes=1500MB

And after calling the script ``transform_from_environment.py`` in the directory of the configuration file,
all prefixed environment variables are transformed into a new configuration file ``instance-from-environment.yaml``:

.. code-block:: YAML

    default_context:
        db_blob_mode: cache
        db_cache_size: '50000'
        db_cache_size_bytes: 1500MB
        db_relstorage: postgresql
        db_relstorage_keep_history: false
        db_relstorage_postgresql_dsn: host='db' dbname='plone' user='plone' password='verysecret'
        db_storage: relstorage
        debug_mode: false
        initial_user_name: admin
        initial_user_password: ''
        verbose_security: false
        wsgi_fast_listen: ''
        wsgi_listen: 127.0.0.1:8080
        zcml_package_includes: my.fancy.package

As special case is, if we want the value to represent a dict/mapping.
The helper script supports this by using a "_DICT_ as separator.
The environment variables

.. code-block:: bash

    export INSTANCE_a_DICT_b="value b"
    export INSTANCE_a_DICT_c="value c"

will be transformed into

.. code-block:: YAML

    default_context:
       a:
            b: value b
            c: value c

This works recursive and updates existing values in the configuration file.

It is useful to modify the ``environment`` settings in the configuration file, i.e. like so to reduce the loaded languages to English and German:

.. code-block:: bash

    export INSTANCE_environment_DICT_PTS_LANGUAGES="de en"
    export INSTANCE_environment_DICT_zope_i18n_allowed_languages=="de en"


Rationale
=========

Base
----

Problem
    We no longer want to use buildout and need a replacement for the old feature rich buildout recipe `plone.recipe.zope2instance` to configure zope.
    The old recipe uses python string templates and is not very intuitive to write and maintain.

Idea
    `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io>`_ is a widespread utility to create text-based code and configuration file-system structures.
    Let's utilize it's power and wrap it with a thin package to simplify it's usage and add minor features needed for out use case.

Difference
----------

to ``plone.recipe.zope2instance``

variable names
    They changed.
    "Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!" (import this)

``Sentry``
    It was possible to configure Sentry.
    Now use `collective.sentry <https://pypi.org/project/collective.sentry/>`_ - much better.

The ``ctl.py``
    Move now to use `mxmake <https://pypi.org/project/mxmake/>`_, which already has support for this cookiecutter
